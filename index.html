  <h2>Recent Discussions </h2>
  <p><b>A New Correlation Coefficient [11th Apr 2024]: </b>A novel correlation coefficient, denoted as $$\xi_{n}(X,Y)$$  has been introduced recently. This coefficient, being non-parametric, offers simplicity in calculation while possessing the capability to identify non-monotonic and non-linear relationships. Moreover, it exhibits some nice asymptotic properties.</p>
  <p><b>Multithreading and Multiprocessing [28th Feb 2024]:</b> Discussion around what exactly is multithreading and multiprocessing, what are the differences between them, and when and how can we use them.</p>
  <p><b>Simulated Annealing [8th Jan 2024]:</b> Simulated Annealing is a method to find an approximate global optimum. Initially, we explore different solutions using a random walk procedure. But with more iterations, we try to settle down. 
  Exploration is necessary to get out of the local optima. This method has a philosophical aspect as well. Initially, we explore many things in life, but eventually, we try to settle down.</p>

  <p><b>Simulated Annealing[8th Jan, 2023]: </b> Simulated Annealing is a method to find an apprximate global optimum. Contrary to other popular method, here we move away from local optimum by using random walk. Initially, we explore different solutions using random walk but with more iterations we try to settle down. Exploration is necessary to get out of the local optima. If you think, this method has a philosophical aspect as well, initially we explore lot many things in life but with time, we try to settle down.</p>
